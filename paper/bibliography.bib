	doi = {10.3847/1538-4357/ab2873},
	abstract = {We present a model for the interaction of the GD-1 stellar stream with a massive perturber that naturally explains many of the observed stream features, including a gap and an off-stream spur of stars. The model involves an impulse by a fast encounter, after which the stream grows a loop of stars at different orbital energies. At specific viewing angles, this loop appears offset from the stream track. A quantitative comparison of the spur and gap features prefers models where the perturber is in the mass range of \$10{\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. Orbit integrations back in time show that the stream encounter could not have been caused by any known globular cluster or dwarf galaxy with a determined orbit, and mass, size and impact-parameter arguments show that it could not have been caused by a molecular cloud in the Milky Way disk. The most plausible explanation for the gap-and-spur structure is an encounter with a dark-matter substructure, like those predicted to populate galactic halos in LCDM cosmology. However, the expected densities of LCDM subhalos in this mass range and in this part of the Milky Way are \$2-3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$ lower than the inferred density of the GD-1 perturber. This observation opens up the possibility that detailed observations of streams could measure the mass spectrum of dark-matter substructures and even identify individual substructures and their orbits in the Galactic halo.},

	doi = {10.1088/0004-637x/705/2/l223},
	abstract = {Star streams in galactic halos are long, thin, unbound structures that will be disturbed by the thousands of dark matter subhalos that are predicted to be orbiting within the main halo. A subhalo generally induces a localized wave in the stream which often evolves into a "z-fold" as an initially trailing innermost part rotates faster than an initially leading outermost part. The folding, which becomes increasingly complex with time, leads to an apparent velocity dispersion increase and thickening of the stream. We measure the equivalent velocity dispersion around the local mean in the simulations, finding that it rises to about 10 km s–1 after 5 Gyr and 20 km s–1 after 13 Gyr. The currently available measurements of the velocity dispersion of halo star streams range from as small as 2 km s–1 to slightly over 20 km s–1. The streams with velocity dispersions of 15-20 km s–1 are compatible with what subhalo heating would produce. A dynamical understanding of the low velocity dispersion streams depends on the time since the progenitor's tidal disruption into a thin stream. If the streams are nearly as old as their stars then subhalos cannot be present with the predicted numbers and masses. However, the dynamical age of the streams can be significantly less than the stars. If the three lowest velocity streams are assigned ages of 3 Gyr, they are in conflict with the subhalo heating. The main conclusion is that star stream heating is a powerful and simple test for subhalo structure.},

We demonstrate how our results are dependent upon the mass of the subhalo and the location of the impact along the stream.

	abstract = {CDM simulations predict that there are hundreds of lumps of with masses greater than 10e7 solar masses in the Milky Way halo. However, we know of only a dozen dwarf satellites close to this mass. Are these lumps simply lacking in stars or is there a fundamental flaw in our most popular cosmology? By studying the tidal debris of known satellites we can potentially address this question. In this paper, we quantify the the effects of the dark matter lumps on tidal tails. The lumps scatter stars in the tidal tails from their original orbits producing a distinctive signature. We simulate debris evolution in smooth and lumpy halos potentials and use our simulations to motivate and test a statistical measure of the degree of scattering apparent in the angular position and radial velocity measurement of debris stars - the ``scattering index''. We find that the scattering index can in general distinguish between the levels of substructure predicted by CDM cosmologies and smooth Milky Way models, but that the sensitivity of the debris depends on the orientation of the parent satellite's orbit relative to the largest lumps orbits. 
We apply our results to the carbon star stream associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) and find that these stars appear to be more scattered than we expect for debris orbiting in a smooth halo. However, the degree of scattering is entirely consistent with that expected due to the influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is on an orbit that intersects Sgr's own. We conclude that the current data is unable to constrain CDM models. Nevertheless, our study suggests that future data sets of debris stars associated with other Milky Way satellites could provide strong constraints on CDM models.},

There, within the stellar halo, these dark pellets will bombard tidal streams as they travel around the Galaxy, causing small but recognizable damage to the stream density distribution. The detection and characterization of these stream ruptures will allow us to constrain the details of the subhalo-stream interaction.

We have also simulated a sample of 6 ultra-highly resolved Milky-way sized halos, allowing us to estimate the halo-to-halo scatter in substructure statistics. In our largest simulation, we resolve nearly 300,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within the virialized region of the halo. Simulations of the same object differing in mass resolution by factors up to 1800 accurately reproduce the largest subhalos with the same mass, maximum circular velocity and position, and yield good convergence for the abundance and internal properties of dark matter substructures. We detect up to four generations of subhalos within subhalos, but contrary to recent claims, we find less substructure in subhalos than in the main halo when regions of equal mean overdensity are compared. The overall substructure mass fraction is much lower in subhalos than in the main halo. Extrapolating the main halo's subhalo mass spectrum down to an Earth mass, we predict the mass fraction in substructure to be well below 3\% within 100 kpc, and to be below 0.1\% within the Solar Circle. The inner density profiles of subhalos show no sign of converging to a fixed asymptotic slope and are well fit by gently curving profiles of Einasto form. The mean concentrations of isolated halos are accurately described by the fitting formula of Neto et al. down to maximum circular velocities of 1.5 km/s, an extrapolation over some 5 orders of magnitude in mass. However, at equal maximum circular velocity, subhalos are more concentrated than field halos, with a characteristic density that is typically {\textasciitilde}2.6 times larger and increases towards the halo centre.},

Analytical estimates of the frequency and energy scales of stream encounters indicate that these missing satellites should have a negligible effect on hot debris structures, such as the tails from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. However, long cold streams, such as the structure known as GD1 or those from the globular cluster Palomar 5 (Pal 5), are expected to suffer many tens of direct impacts from missing satellites during their lifetimes. Numerical experiments confirm that these impacts create gaps in the debris' orbital energy distribution, which will evolve into degree- and sub-degree-scale fluctuations in surface density over the age of the debris. Maps of Pal 5's own stream contain surface density fluctuations on these scales. The presence and frequency of these inhomogeneities suggests the existence of a population of missing satellites in numbers predicted in the standard ΛCDM cosmologies.},

The size and the number of gaps in the stream are measured using a filter which approximates the structure of the gaps found in stream simulations. We find 5 gaps that are at least 99\% confidence detections with about a dozen gaps at 90\% confidence. The statistical significance of a gap is estimated using bootstrap resampling of the control regions on either side of the stream. The density minimum closest to the cluster is likely the result of the epicyclic orbits of the tidal outflow and has been discounted. To create the number of 99\% confidence gaps per unit length at the mean age of the stream requires a halo population of nearly a thousand dark matter sub-halos with peak circular velocities above 1 km s{\textasciicircum}(–1) within 30 kpc of the galactic center.

In fact, this is the most promising technique for dark substructure detection and characterization as such gaps grow with time, magnifying small perturbations into clear signatures observable by ongoing and planned Galaxy surveys. To facilitate such future inference, we develop a comprehensive framework for studies of the growth of the stream density perturbations. Starting with simple assumptions and restricting to streams on circular orbits, we derive analytic formulae that describe the evolution of all gap properties (size, density contrast etc) at all times. We uncover complex, previously unnoticed behavior, with the stream initially forming a density enhancement near the subhalo impact point. Shortly after, a gap forms due to the relative change in period induced by the subhalo's passage. There is an intermediate regime where the gap grows linearly in time. At late times, the particles in the stream overtake each other, forming caustics, and the gap grows like \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{t\}\$. In addition to the secular growth, we find that the gap oscillates as it grows due to epicyclic motion. We compare this analytic model to N-body simulations and find an impressive level of agreement. Importantly, when analyzing the observation of a single gap we find a large degeneracy between the subhalo mass, the impact geometry and kinematics, the host potential and the time since flyby.},

The Pal 5 stream is one such system for which we have some of the best data. However, Pal 5 orbits close to the center of the Milky Way and has passed through the Galactic disk many times, where its structure can be perturbed by baryonic structures such as the Galactic bar and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). In order to understand how these baryonic structures affect Pal 5's density, we present a detailed study of the effects of the Galactic bar, spiral structure, GMCs, and globular clusters on the Pal 5 stream. We estimate the effect of each perturber on the stream density by computing its power spectrum and comparing it to the power induced by a CDM-like population of dark matter subhalos. We find that the bar, spiral structure, and GMCs can each individually create power that is comparable to the observed power on large scales, leaving little room for dark matter substructure. On degree scales, the power induced by the bar and spirals is small, but GMCs create small-scale density variations that are much larger in amplitude than the dark-matter induced variations but otherwise indistinguishable from it.

	abstract = {Gravitational encounters between small-scale dark matter substructure and cold stellar streams in the Milky Way halo lead to density perturbations in the latter, making streams an effective probe for detecting dark matter substructure. The Pal 5 stream is one such system for which we have some of the best data. However, Pal 5 orbits close to the centre of the Milky Way and has passed through the Galactic disc many times, where its structure can be perturbed by baryonic structures such as the Galactic bar and giant molecular clouds (GMCs). In order to understand how these baryonic structures affect Pal 5’s density, we present a detailed study of the effects of the Galactic bar, spiral structure, GMCs, and globular clusters on the Pal 5 stream. We estimate the effect of each perturber on the stream density by computing its power spectrum and comparing it to the power induced by a CDM-like population of dark matter subhaloes. We find that the bar and GMCs can each individually create power that is comparable to the observed power on large scales, leaving little room for dark matter substructure, while spirals are subdominant on all scales. On degree scales, the power induced by the bar is small, but GMCs create small-scale density variations that are similar in amplitude to the dark-matter induced variations but otherwise indistinguishable from it.

	abstract = {Stars that escape globular clusters form tidal tails that are predominantly shaped by the global distribution of mass in the Galaxy, but also preserve a historical record of small-scale perturbations. Using deep \$grz\$ photometry from DECaLS, we present highly probable members of the tidal tails associated with the disrupting globular cluster Palomar 5. These data yield the cleanest view of a stellar stream beyond \${\textbackslash}sim20{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm kpc\$ and reveal: (1) a wide, low surface-brightness extension of the leading tail; (2) significant density variations along the stream; and (3) sharp changes in the direction of both the leading and the trailing tail. In the fiducial Milky Way model, a rotating bar perturbs the Palomar 5 tails and can produce streams with similar width and density profiles to those observed. However, the deviations of the stream track in this simple model do not match those observed in the Palomar 5 trailing tail, indicating the need for an additional source of perturbation. These discoveries open up the possibility of measuring the population of perturbers in the Milky Way, including dark-matter subhalos, with an ensemble of stellar streams and deep photometry alone.},

	doi = {10.3847/2041-8213/ab36ba},
	abstract = {In simple models of the Milky Way, tidally disrupting satellites produce long and thin---nearly one-dimensional---stellar streams. Using astrometric data from the Gaia second data release and photometry from the Dark Energy Survey, we demonstrate that the Jhelum stream, a stellar stream in the inner halo, is a two-dimensional structure. The spatial distribution of highly probable Jhelum members reveals a dense thin component and an associated diffuse, spatially offset component. These two spatial components have indistinguishable proper motions (at \${\textbackslash}sigma{\textbackslash}sim1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm mas{\textbackslash},yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ level) and a similar ratio of blue straggler to blue horizontal branch stars, which indicates a common origin for the two components. The best-fit orbit to the narrow component (pericenter \$8{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm kpc\$, apocenter \$24{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm kpc\$), however, does not explain the wide component of the Jhelum stream. On the other hand, an older orbital wrap of Jhelum's orbit traces the Indus stream, indicating a possible connection between these two structures and additional complexity in Jhelum's formation. Substructure in the Jhelum progenitor or precession of its tidal debris in the Milky Way potential may explain the observed structure of Jhelum. Future spectroscopic data will enable discrimination between these "nature" and "nurture" formation scenarios. Jhelum adds to the growing list of cold stellar streams that display complex morphologies and promise to reveal the dynamical history of the Milky Way.},

	abstract = {A massive object crossing a narrow stream of stars orbiting in the halo of the galaxy induces velocity changes both along and transverse to the stream that can lead to the development of a visible gap. For a stream narrow relative to its orbital radius, the stream crossing time is sufficiently short that the impact approximation can be used to derive the changes in angular momenta and radial actions along the star stream. The epicyclic approximation is used to calculate the evolution of the density of the stream as it orbits around in a galactic potential. Analytic expressions are available for a point mass, however, the general expressions are easily numerically evaluated for perturbing objects with arbitrary density profiles. With a simple allowance for the velocity dispersion of the stream, moderately warm streams can be modeled. The predicted evolution agrees well with the outcomes of simulations of stellar streams for streams with widths up to 1\% of the orbital radius of the stream. The angular momentum distribution within the stream shears out gaps with time, further reducing the visibility of streams, although the size of the shear effect requires more detailed simulations that account for the creation of the stream. An illustrative model indicates that shear will set a lower limit of a few times the stream width for the length of gaps that persist. In general, the equations are useful for dynamical insights into the development of stream gaps and their measurement.},

	abstract = {We report on the detection in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data of a 63 degree-long tidal stream of stars, extending from Ursa Major to Cancer. The stream has no obvious association with the orbit of any known cluster or galaxy. The contrast of the detected stream is greatest when using a star count filter that is matched to the color-magnitude distribution of stars in M 13, which suggests that the stars making up the stream are old and metal poor. The visible portion of the stream is very narrow and about 8.5 kpc above the Galactic disk, suggesting that the progenitor is or was a globular cluster. While the surface density of the stream varies considerably along its length, its path on the sky is very smooth and uniform, showing no evidence of perturbations by large mass concentrations in the nearby halo. While definitive constraints cannot be established without velocity information, the stream's projected path and estimates of its distance suggest that we are observing the stream near the perigalacticon of its orbit.},

	volume = {126},
	doi = {10.1086/378601},
	abstract = {Using wide-field photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we recently showed that the Galactic globular cluster Palomar 5 is in the process of being tidally disrupted. Its tidal tails were initially detected in a 25 wide band along the celestial equator. A new analysis of SDSS data for a larger field now reveals that the tails of Pal 5 have a much larger spatial extent and can be traced over an arc of 10? on the sky, corresponding to a projected length of 4 kpc at the distance of the cluster. The tail that trails behind the Galactic motion of the cluster fades into the field at an angular distance of 65 from the cluster center but shows a pronounced density maximum between 2? and 4? from the center. The leading tail, of length 35, extends down to the border of the available field and thus presumably continues beyond it. The projected width of these tails is small and almost constant (FWHM {\textasciitilde} 120 pc), which implies that they form a dynamically cold and hence long-lived structure. The number of former cluster stars found in the tails adds up to about 1.2 times the number of stars in the cluster, that is, the tails are more massive than the cluster in its present state. The radial profile of stellar surface density in the tails approximately follows a power law r? with -1.5 ? ? ? -1.2. The stream of debris from Pal 5 is significantly curved, which demonstrates its acceleration by the Galactic potential. The stream sets tight constraints on the geometry of the cluster's Galactic orbit. We conclude that the cluster is presently near the apocenter but has repeatedly undergone disk crossings in the inner part of the Galaxy leading to strong tidal shocks. Using the spatial offset between the tails and the cluster's orbit, we estimate the mean drift rate of the tidal debris and thus the mean mass-loss rate of the cluster. Our results suggest that the observed debris originates mostly from mass loss within the last 2 Gyr. The cluster is likely to be destroyed after the next disk crossing, which will happen in about 100 Myr. There is strong evidence against the suggestion that Pal 5 might be associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy.},

Deep, two-color, photographic photometry is used to select and count stars with colors and magnitudes consistent with cluster-specific, color-magnitude sequences. The resulting reduction in the number of contaminating foreground stars allows us to push the star counts to significantly lower surface densities than has previously been possible. We find that most of our sample clusters show extra-tidal wings in their surface density profiles. The form of the surface density profiles is consistent with recent numerical studies of the tidal stripping of globular clusters. Two-dimensional surface density maps for several clusters are consistent with the expected appearance of tidal tails, with allowance for the effects of orbit shape, orbital phase, and orientation of our line of sight. We identify the extra-tidal material with stars which are still in the process of being removed from the clusters. The extra-tidal stars effectively limit the accuracy to which we can resolve the ``tidal'' radii of globular clusters. However, by tracing the orbital paths of their parent clusters, these stars may also facilitate a renewed attack on the problem of determining globular cluster orbits and the shape of the Galactic potential field.},
