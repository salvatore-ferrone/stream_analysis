# Stream Analysis

This repository is a cleaned up version of all the code I use to analyze my streams that were created with t_strippy. It is the code that is supporting the upcoming publication.

This has a bit of a way to go before it's perfect. At the start, all of the code was developed in seperate folders and acted independently. I need to build the chain. 




## /code/
Ideally, everything here should be performing computations only

## /jobs/
Things that perform I/O. Mix of slurm scripts and python code

## /analysis/
anything that produces plots or data tables or statistics 

## /notebooks/
for now just scrap. Perhaps eventually notebooks will turn into a tutorial so I don't forget in the event that I need to comeback in the future.
