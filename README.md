# Stream Analysis

This repository is a cleaned up version of all the code I use to analyze my streams that were created with t_strippy. It is the code that is supporting the upcoming publication.

This has a bit of a way to go before it's perfect. At the start, all of the code was developed in seperate folders and acted independently. I need to build the chain.
